# Botium Toys Security Audit & Compliance

## Case Study: Botium Toys

Botium Toys is a small U.S.-based toy manufacturer and retailer with a single physical location that serves as its main office, storefront, and warehouse. Despite its modest physical presence, the company's online operations have expanded significantly, drawing in customers from both the U.S. and abroad. This growth has placed additional pressure on Botium Toys' Information Technology (IT) department to support the burgeoning online market.

The IT department manager has recognized the need for an internal IT audit to address the lack of a comprehensive strategy for business continuity and compliance as the company grows. An internal audit would provide insights into securing the company's infrastructure and identifying and mitigating potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager also seeks to ensure compliance with regulations governing online payment processing and conducting business in the European Union (EU).

To initiate the audit, the IT manager has begun implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). This involves defining the scope and goals of the audit, cataloging the assets currently managed by the IT department, and conducting a risk assessment. The primary objective of the audit is to offer a comprehensive overview of potential risks and penalties the company may face due to its existing security practices.

Your task is to evaluate the IT manager's scope, goals, and risk assessment report. You will then conduct an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
